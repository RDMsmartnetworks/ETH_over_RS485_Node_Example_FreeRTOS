# ETH_on_RS485_Node_Example_FreeRTOS
This a an example software code and hardware schematic package for using a custom made STM32F412VE Board connected to a RS485 bus communicating with ethernet stiled frames. To get the ethernet frames to its desired OSI 1 level specification the ethernet to rs485 converter is needed, which is also provided for free under following repository: https://github.com/RDMsmartnetworks/ETH_to_RS485_Converter_Baremetal
